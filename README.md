# MyReads: A Book Tracking App. (Udacity React Nanodegree, Project 1)

> Javier Ezpeleta. Madrid, Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

## About

This is the first project for the Udacity React Nanodegree.
Assign a shelf to each book. Search for books, change their state, then go back to the main page and it will be updated on-the-fly.
Extra: each option (shelf) will tell you know many books there are currently at that place.
Extra: animations added to some elements (page headers and book components)
Hope you like it!
